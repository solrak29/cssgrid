CSS GRID is a repository where I will store templates, play with grid features, and documents any thoughts on the subject.

## Background

I've always felt that the grid is a vital component for any UI to be really useful.
Alot of 3rd party companies have done really well with offering this feature as part
of their UI components.  In general, you could not find this feature for free.

I am huge advocate that all UI will eventually fall to the web.  As the HTML standard
evolves and browsers continue to support the standard features, we will essentially
no longer require native interfaces for UI components in most cases.

A while back in developing a tracking application for horse races I needed a grid.  I had
a friend who is a web developer who created a grid with css from scratch.  As he was seasoned
front end web developer this was fairly easy for him to flesh out quickly.  However, it 
was very basic and required lots of trial and error and time.  I continued this work on
my own which led me to the concept of having a grid as the foundation for laying out
website design [w3schools grid layout](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_grid.asp)
*NOTE: I will add the template here for future reference.*

Next, I found Bootstrap that already did a lot of heavy css lifting for you to create professional
quality web interfaces and included a grid.  At about the same time, I ran across many videos that showed
HTML supporting a grid component in CSS core.  This makes absolute sense for UI development
and having the browser type interface to be the core UI for all applications.  

Then, I ran into this youtube video that finally motivated me to get started: [CSS GRID YouTube Vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgwCeNVPlo0)
This was a quick tutorial to get my feet wet and create this repository for future reference
and templates.

Finally, it goes to show, as the HTML core components (i.e. css ) support needed UI features, we
don't have to rely on 3rd party prodcuts.  I have seen organizations invest heavily
in 3rd party components for various reasons, but it is essential to use the core products if
possible.  I am huge advocat with the business policy/model/methodology to use a 3rd party
vendors to achieve time to market.  However, to be really competitive, any organizaiton should 
invest in their technology and not realy on 3rd party vendor otherwise. 

But that's a topic for a different time.
