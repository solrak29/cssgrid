# cssgrid
CSS GRID is a repository where I will store templates, play with features, and documents any thoughts on the subjects.

#Background

I've always felt that grid is a vital component for the web interface to be really useful.
Espcially, in working in the investment banking space and/or many other domains the biggest
UI component is the grid.

A while back in developing a tracking application for horse races, I needed a grid and the
web developer I worked with started creating a grid with css, but at that time this had
to be created from scratch.  Then, as I conitnued on that work, I found that concept of having
a grid as the foundation for laying out your website design [w3schools grid layout](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_grid.asp)

NOTE: I will add the template here for future reference.

Next, I found bootstrap that already did a lot of heavy css lifting for you to also provide
an reusable interface to get me up and running.  Now the timing at which I ran across many
videos I saw that now HTML is supporting CSS GRID.  This makes absolute sence for UI development
and having the browser type interface to be the core UI for all applications.  

I ran into this youtube video that finally motivated me to get started: [CSS GRID YouTube Vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgwCeNVPlo0)
This was a quick tutorial to get my feet wet and I love that this is being supported.
However there is limited browser support.

Finally, it goes to show as the core components (i.e. css ) support these features then we
don't have to really rely on these 3rd party prodcuts.  I see organizations invest heavily
in these components for various reasons, but it is essential to use the core products if
possible.  I am huge advocat with the business policy/model/methodology to use a 3rd party
vendor to get to time to market, but I feel that any organizaiton should also rapidly in
parralel mimic that 3rd party prodcuct to move to something that is core to their technology.
However, I don't see this in any organization and I suspect that it all boils down to costs
and how much a organaization is investing in it's technology.
